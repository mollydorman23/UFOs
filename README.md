# UFOs

## Project Overview: 

The purpose of this project was to create a website with information about UFO sightings. In order to build the website, we needed to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, create filters to make the table react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file as a visual component.

We then customized the webpage using Bootstrap and added filters on the website itself. We started by building one filter to drill down into the date of the UFO sighting, and then added four more filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 

#### Here is the landing page of our website and what everything looks like without any filters applied:

#### You can see the “Filter Search” section on the left side of the page by scrolling down just a bit. 

Within the filters, you can see the placeholders we added to help guide the user through what to input in each filter box/section. You can narrow your search by inputting a data, city, state, country and/or shape.

#### Here is an example of what it looks like with a key word entered into each of the 5 filters. 

There is no submit button, you simply click off of the filter box into the next box or the webpage and it will load the table with the filters added.

## Summary:

While this is a great start for our UFO sighting webpage, there are some ways we could make the website even more user-friendly.

One drawback of this new design is that unless you really know what you’re looking for in terms of a specific date or a place, you might not know where to start in terms of which filters to add.

I have two recommendations for further development of the webpage:
1. Create dropdowns in at least some of the filter boxes, so users can see a list of different dates/cities/etc. to choose from when they want to filter the data. 
2. Create a “Clear All” button below the filters so you can clear them out without having to delete them one by one.
